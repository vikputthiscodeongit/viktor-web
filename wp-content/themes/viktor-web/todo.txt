Check JavaScript function initialization (incl. cssLoaded())


Alert
  * Accessibility: communicate state changes


WPCF7
  Validation (general)
    * Improve invalid <input> indicator
      > Place cross in <input>?
    * Merge regular <input> validation function with the CAPTCHA one
    * Scroll to first invalid <input> after validation
      > Existing function (wpcf7.input.scrollToInvalid()) has a bug:
        After a failed form submission, scrolls right on the x-axis into the site's overflow

  CAPTCHA
    * Change CAPTCHA behaviour on fresh form load (to one of the following three options):
      a. Prevent form submission the first 3500ms after the first interaction with said form
      b. Prevent form submission the first 3500ms after DOMContentLoaded
      c. Start rapid refresh after the first interaction with the form
    * Generate <label> & <input> in PHP?
    * Generate ID and thus <input> name in PHP?
      > Generate random int
      > Insert in DOM el
      > Get int from DOM el

  * Make .els.remove() a global (wpcf7) helper (& maybe more)
  * Check if the entire thing works with multiple forms on page


<input>
  * Design / accessibility: Change label color (to turquoise?)
  * Accessibility: <label> click should focus input
  * Inline Bootstrap variables in SASS partial (?)


favicon / PWA stuff
.svg content-type header is incorrect according to webhint
